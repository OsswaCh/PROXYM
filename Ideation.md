## Key concepts



[[### Customer journey]]

The customer refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand or company across multiple touchpoints and stages, from initial awareness through to post-purchase interactions and beyond. 

It encompasses every interaction, whether direct or indirect, that contributes to the customer’s perception and relationship with the brand. ⇒ it’s the series of interactions a customer has with a specific company or service as they become aware of a pain point and make a purchase decision

### Value Streams

A value stream represents the end-to-end sequence of activities necessary to deliver value to a customer, whether internal or external.

-  encompasses every step from the initial request (trigger) through to the delivery of value to the customer. It begins with the concept and moves through various stages of development, delivery, and support. Importantly, it always starts and ends with a customer
    
- Perspective: Value streams are usually visualized from the stakeholder’s viewpoint. They focus on how value is achieved for the initiating stakeholder (often the customer). This outside-in perspective [contrasts with internal value chains or process-centric views](https://asana.com/resources/value-streams).(An internal value chain represents the sequence of activities within a company that transforms inputs into outputs. These activities contribute to the creation of value for the final product or service / A process-centric organization structures its work by breaking down tasks or projects into separate, individually executable stages. )
    

  

### Value stream management: 

[Value Stream Management (VSM](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/value-stream-management-vsm)) is a strategic approach and set of practices used by businesses to optimize the end-to-end flow of value – from customer request to product or service delivery. It focuses on two key aspects: (the framework and process of analyzing and improving value streams to maximize efficiencies and minimize waste in the value streams.)

  

- Delivery Speed: How quickly customer-requested features or updates are delivered.
    
- [Value Realization: Whether the customer perceives value from those changes.](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/value-stream-management)
    

  

In essence, [VSM helps organizations streamline software development and delivery efforts, leading to better customer experiences and improved business outcomes](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/value-stream-management)

  

### Omnichannel banking 

is a strategic approach that harmonizes multiple channels (physical and digital) to create a consistent and engaging customer experience. 

  

- Multichannel vs. Omnichannel:
    

- Multichannel refers to various customer touchpoints across different channels (branches, websites, mobile apps, call centers, etc.). However, these channels often operate independently, leading to a disjointed experience.
    
- Omnichannel takes a unified approach, seamlessly integrating all channels. Customers can start an interaction on one channel and continue it on another without disruption.
    

  

# Value stream for banking

[VSM for banking: Creating magic for customers by prioritizing value - Work Life by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/enterprise/accenture-vsm-banking#:~:text=Value%20stream%20management%20optimizes%20customer%20experience%20and%20digital%20innovation)

Focus on the customer is typically not the issue, since many banks have that focus. 

→ The challenge is how to embed it into the operating structure of the organization. In today’s competitive banking environment, 

→!failing to focus on customer value can lead to fewer customers and lower profits. 

→ To avoid this outcome, banks can stay ahead of competitors by accelerating their enterprise agility journey and adopting value stream management (VSM) practices.

  

### History of customer value in banking 

- Relationships between customers and banks was face to face:  In the past, customers would walk into a local branch and friendly employees would help them with current needs and future plans. → customer satisfaction is seen hands on through the customers
    

→ those relationships have been replaced by automated processes → lack of the old evaluation metrics “ large banks often fell short when it comes to meeting customer expectations.”

Why?

- Scale and reach have increased, but achieving the goals of customer personalization and impact is infrequent and distributed.
    
- Competing priorities and numerous tasks hinder banks from delivering customer value, including:
    

- Economic uncertainty
    
- Changing interest rates
    
- Regulatory risk management
    
- Siloed product lines
    
- Technical debt from legacy systems
    

- Legacy systems pose significant challenges.
    

- Existing systems and infrastructures are outdated and lag behind the speed of innovation.
    
- Legacy systems are inadequate for current app, API, and security features, and for processing data for cross-selling.
    
- Successful digital transformation requires addressing technical debt to avoid system instability and enable rapid change.
    

  
  

- Tech-savvy customers seek personalized digital banking experiences with needed products and services.
    
- Traditional banks now compete with niche players like FinTechs, in addition to other banks.
    

  

### Where value streams come into play 

- Banks need to focus on customer value in software planning and development + be innovative and responsive to exceed customer expectations and identify end-to-end value streams for software development.
    

⇒Digital and agile transformations provide a competitive framework for banks.

Value Stream Management (VSM) can uncover systemic issues:

- Murky product ownership.
    
- Separation of responsibilities between running and developing systems.
    
- Siloed customer journeys by product lines, lacking overall customer value tracking across in-person, phone, and digital experiences.
    

Results and benefits 

Delighting customers: Quickly respond to customer requests and market changes with relevant data and streamlined processes.

Increasing visibility: Data-generated charts and graphics show the connection between IT/DevOps workflow and corporate goals, ensuring alignment.

Removing bottlenecks: Identify and address process bottlenecks, preventing significant delays and losses.

Unleashing innovation: Focus on products that matter to customers, reducing unnecessary meetings and maintaining underperforming products.

Improving morale: Attract and retain talented IT staff by involving them in interesting, innovative projects.

- Value stream management (VSM) enhances agile environments by 
    

- aligning people, processes, and data, 
    
- allowing quick responses to opportunities, 
    
- improving customer experiences, 
    
- reducing waste.
    

- VSM identifies valuable products and services for customers, such as 
    

- secure, frictionless mobile banking apps that facilitate deposits, payments, and money transfers in a single session.

### [VSM in action: Bank example](https://www.hcltech.com/blogs/value-stream-management-in-action-banking-on-transformation) 

  

To clarify what value stream management means in the context of a modern-day organization and its business operations, we’ve simplified an example of a bank and how it provides loans to its customers. 

- Customer Interaction with Banks: Customers interact with banks through various channels, and their experiences are shaped by the bank's value stream.
    
- Definition of Value from Customer's Standpoint: Value can be seen in terms of ease of obtaining a loan, customer satisfaction, process duration, simplicity, and overall ease of the process.
    
- Example of a Value Stream: A value stream, like the process of delivering a loan, involves several stages from application to fund disbursement.
    
- Components of a Value Stream: A value stream consists of sequential stages or activities, involving people and supported by systems at each stage.
    

  

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeAic7Sox4XkaEGDBHP8GzSaNTa3Y4DEDkAg2t1347LLz6BLY2mzw4dWevkKfcik17hljJnBO7J7bTNctH7H8AtK0SjiVjxlJ_LI9DEEJjtT8K1-KiEHfBiWW2t4GlIk_rBLW4hL_p-Xi5HVbsf?key=mPcK0daQK4eoV8olleA2PA)

  

(stages/ activities of the value stream)

  

How to go about it:  
1- Issue Identification: The bank notices its customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores for loan processing are below the industry average.

2- Value Stream Management (VSM) Approach:

- Value Stream Identification: The bank identifies the value stream involved in loan processing.
    
- Value Stream Mapping: A visual representation of systems, processes, and people involved is created.
    
- Identify Areas of Improvement: Issues are identified, such as lengthy application forms, outdated data processing tools, and cumbersome data points for loan authorization.
    
- Implement Improvements:
    

- Pre-fill application data from pre-qualification documents.
    
- Upgrade data processing tools.
    
- Use AI & ML for better and faster decision-making in loan authorization.
    

- Continuous Monitoring: The bank periodically assesses the effectiveness of these changes and identifies new improvement areas.
    

3- Benefits of VSM: Improved efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced customer experience, competitiveness, and customer attraction.

4- General Application of Value Streams: Value streams exist in various forms across industries and organizations, with potential hierarchies and sub-streams.

  
  

## [VSM case study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705815004269?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8a53c8748c807781) 

### Principle, mission and start

#### Beginnings

- Started in the second third of the twentieth century by the Toyota Motors Company → later became one of the fundamental methods od lean management 
    

#### Philosophy 

- Stands on a graphic representation of the value chain flow from recieving customer’s demand through its logistic and transformation process to delivery of final product
    
- Divides processes into two groups: 
    

- Value adding (VA)
    
- Non value addin (NVA) 
    

- The outcome of VSM is a chat representing value flow across the company
    
- ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfU-InJgNJQ8Ar_8sXEJeGndh1xU_oZkPSETBPdhomfROoF2RYdQFSa-yCgCDa6ECJVUS-rcLk8u_058W4r1-ttYpQLxtzbZGUtFQe4jPKorITkjqu0iUbWkKYjh5FchmG1nxDdPeeMKMFXaX4pJg?key=mPcK0daQK4eoV8olleA2PA)
    

  

- Importance of Inventories in NVA Processes: Inventories are a key non-value-adding (NVA) process, indicating periods of overstock relative to tact time.
    
- Calculation of Inventory Value: This is determined by dividing the number of stored product-material items by their daily demand based on customer needs.
    

#### Objective of VSM: 

To eliminate unnecessary inventories and reallocate finances tied up in them.

- Benefits of Reducing Inventories: Freed-up finances can be used to stabilize cash flow, pay extra dividends, or fund new projects.
    
- Hidden Problems: Inventories often mask underlying issues that hinder achieving strategic goals.
    
- Role of VSM: The method helps identify appropriate solutions to these hidden problems.

### The case study: 

Company Background: The enterprise manufactures plastic products for the pharmacy and healthcare industry.

Management Methods: The company employs modern project and process management methods such as Six Sigma, TQM, 5S, SMED, and Kaizen.

Strategic Goals (2014-2018): Goals are divided into three groups:

- Q-group: Quality goals related to manufacturing processes.
    
- L-group: Logistic goals related to logistics and storage processes.
    
- C-group: Cost goals focused on personnel costs.
    

Balanced Scorecard Method: Strategic goals are detailed into yearly, quarterly, and monthly plans with specific KPIs.

KPI Documentation: Simplified KPI documents are used to track performance and are presented to top management as primary information sources.

Averaging KPIs Issue: when the company averages KPI (Key Performance Indicator) values across the entire organization, it can mask the differences in performance between various product groups and departments. This "arithmetic-average-trap" makes it difficult to pinpoint specific areas where waste and inefficiencies exist. As a result, the primary function of identifying problems within the value chain is compromised, as the averaging process blurs significant performance variations and hides specific issues that need addressing.

  

For the rest of the  case study we will be focusing only on L-group kpi

###  Performance Evaluation

1. Logistic Conception and Storage:
    

- The VSM method shows the dependency on external storage, 27 km from production.
    
- VSM map reveals the current logistics demand high transportation between manufacturing and the warehouse.
    

3. Lead Time:
    

- The actual lead time is 296 days, much higher than the target of 96 days.
    
- The goal breakdown: RAW (77 days) + SEMI-FINISHED (12 days) + FINISHED (7 days) + VA time (79 sec) = 96 days.
    

5. KPI Discrepancy:
    

- The VSM map indicates non-fulfillment of KPIs, contradicting the KPI documents claiming compliance.
    
- The arithmetic-average-trap is evident due to 15 other value chains in the company.
    

7. Financial Implications:
    

- About 276,000 EUR tied up in unnecessary inventories for the selected value chain.
    
- Unnecessary inventories require 100 pallets of extra capacity at external storage.
    
- Annual financial loss is 16,000 EUR due to wasted resources and storage costs.
    
- This figure applies to one product line, implying potential larger issues.
    

###  Analysis and Problem-Solving Procedures

1. Root Cause Identification:
    

- VSM analysis triggers identification of root causes using methods like 5 Whys, Ishikawa Chart, 5W2H, etc.
    

3. Analytical Nature of VSM:
    

- VSM is analytical and does not solve problems by itself.
    
- Problems identified by VSM need to be addressed using other methods, such as lean methods.
    

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe23H6mSXnoG-x3KudyVJBDDkq6qN8Yjz2xVPEPv18lBpgw1ZjL1nxCDiyswt17tVQeLLhxozHtDkiHOz4mfxpt-bk3SC6VL09s5GFBWa3B4cvUbNllHGuWUWUVrueZ4IPLXOEi8Gocsb4ihUQ3tw?key=mPcK0daQK4eoV8olleA2PA)

### Creation of the VSM Future Map and Identified Problems, Their Causes, and Proposals for Potential Improvements

1. Current Logistic Conception Issues:
    

- The existing logistic system is complex, administratively and logistically difficult, with many human interactions leading to errors and waste.
    
- Solution: Reduce human factor involvement in purchase, quality, and storage processes.
    

3. Problem Identification and Solutions:
    

- Problems and causes were identified using the 5 Whys method.
    
- Possible solutions were proposed through brainstorming with company workers.
    
- Proposed improvements are categorized into:
    

- Simple incremental improvements with small investment costs.
    
- More difficult improvements within the current logistic system.
    
- Radical process reengineering improvements.
    

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdGonLBH1LsXkwq_VA3wl9z5rwE22oi3_xcC97qsrNorC3PDC-gxvrxw46SLPIwiAO4njLlJsq3wPO0fL5hz9xxKHvluAOwpyqSlUFU0eXgD-I6Wc07SR6123JyUaUFbX6zxGhR3NwbuHt8iCNe?key=mPcK0daQK4eoV8olleA2PA)

3. Impact on KPIs:
    

- Each proposed improvement aims to meet L-category KPIs (logistics goals).
    
- Special VSM reports can prevent the arithmetic-average-trap and provide more accurate inventory management.
    

5. Cost and Benefit Analysis:
    

- Rising production (59%) and transport/storage costs (163%) from 2014-2018 necessitate improvement.
    
- Discussion on building an own logistics center to save about 1 million EUR annually.
    
- Simple projects use a simple term of recoverability (SToR).
    
- Larger projects require sophisticated economic methods like NPV, IRR, EVA, CFROI, and risk management.
    

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfb5b0oSRca2KHKKgcUYmnCRIc7r3SgFYR-aur_6hl_R1nmmMw4JGyKTUPKdMKHc7be53-rHMk5IpZ5owCnpGywirgcaz4N58MUX9TFLYzgXzYDrBF45HHf7n4lNTbQs_OEqrVvJ8hWTjfjYvU6Kw?key=mPcK0daQK4eoV8olleA2PA)

5. Project Evaluation:
    

- Portfolio attitude and mathematical optimization recommended for decision-making on projects with limited financial resources.
    
- Simpler projects may be better decided by practical manager intellect due to difficulty in accurate cost estimation.
    

7. Large Investment Project:
    

- Example: Constructing a logistics center with 45 million EUR investment, expected to be profitable within eight years.
    
- Positive evaluation using NPV and IRR (own capital costs = 7.71%).
    

9. Implementation and Outcomes:
    

- Three simple incremental improvements already implemented: assessment of employee competencies, strict time deadlines for quality acceptance processes, and preparation of special VSM reports.
    
- Improvements show potential to fulfill approved KPIs and demonstrate three times higher efficiency compared to the current state.
    
- VSM improves process functionality, leading to better cash flow and financial health of the company.

## Vsm projection on other fields: [health industry example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259414/) 

Methodology: The economic- and process-driven terminology of lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System is first presented, including information and product flow as well as value stream mapping (VSM), and then applied to an interdisciplinary setting of physicians, nurses and technicians from different medical departments to identify wastes in the process of endovascular stent procurement in interventional radiology.

  

Lean Target and Waste Elimination:

- The ultimate goal is to eliminate waste (muda), defined as anything that adds cost or time without adding value.
    
- Waste is identified and categorized using the "seven wastes" framework from Toyota's TPS (Toyota Production System).
    

Seven Wastes:

- Waste of overproducing: Not applicable to stents, but overordering can lead to waste of inventory.
    
- Waste of waiting: Addressed by improving information flow and scheduling to reduce delays in stent orders and patient treatments.
    
- Waste of transport: Minimized by optimizing logistics and direct delivery of stents to the angio suite to reduce handling and inspections.
    
- Waste of processing: Managed by ensuring interventions are comprehensive initially, reducing the need for additional procedures.
    
- Waste of inventory: Reduced by implementing a kanban system in the angio suite for demand-driven stent orders, eliminating excess stock.
    
- Waste of motion: Addressed through standard operating procedures (SOPs) and visual labeling to minimize unnecessary movements during procedures.
    
- Waste of defects and spoilage: Mitigated by improving staff expertise and supervision to prevent errors and reworks.
    

Procurement vs. Medical Perspectives:

- Perspectives differ in terms of how wastes manifest and are managed, highlighting the need for tailored solutions.
    
- Solutions include digital ordering systems, SOPs, kanban systems, and improved logistics coordination.
    

Interdisciplinary Approach:

- Involves referrers, conductors (interventional radiologists), and specialists to streamline the entire process from order to treatment.
    
- Emphasizes collaboration and process understanding across different departments and roles.
    

Continuous Improvement:

- The use of VSM facilitates ongoing improvements by identifying and eliminating inefficiencies systematically.
    
- Focuses on achieving smoother, value-added processes through waste reduction and process optimization.
    

  

Discussion 

1. VSM vs. Process Maps:
    

- Process Maps: Simple and intuitive tools used in Kaizen events to visualize sequences of activities leading to a product. They help employees understand their roles and interactions but often do not capture information flows comprehensively.
    
- VSM: Specifically designed to map information flows along with material flows, making it more suitable for analyzing and improving complex processes like those in hospitals. VSM provides a holistic view that includes both value-adding and non-value-adding activities.
    

3. Role in Waste Reduction:
    

- Lean Manufacturing Paradigm: Focuses on minimizing waste to maximize flow, as outlined in the Toyota Production System (TPS).
    
- VSM in Lean: Integral to lean principles, VSM identifies and eliminates various types of waste such as overproduction, waiting, unnecessary transport, processing inefficiencies, excess inventory, unnecessary motion, and defects.
    
- Holistic Approach: Unlike sporadic improvements, lean involves a systematic approach where tools like VSM are used collaboratively across the value stream. This approach ensures that improvements are aligned with overarching strategic goals, enhancing overall flow and reducing waste more effectively.
    

5. Challenges and Benefits:
    

- Mindset Shift: Becoming truly lean requires a cultural shift towards continuous improvement and waste elimination throughout the organization.
    
- Strategic Integration: Organizations that integrate lean principles strategically find it more cost-effective and sustainable in the long term, avoiding the pitfalls of isolated problem-solving efforts.
    

### Practical Implications

Value Stream Mapping serves as a crucial tool in not only visualizing process flows comprehensively but also in strategizing to reduce waste effectively across complex systems like healthcare. It supports the lean manufacturing goal of continuous improvement by enabling organizations to identify inefficiencies, streamline processes, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

  
  

## [Why Most Organizations Aren't Using VSM](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/important-ways-we-fail-learn-from-toyota-david-verble/)

Misconceptions about VSM:

- Many organizations create Current State maps but fail to update or integrate them with Future State designs, missing the point of continuous improvement.
    
- The real purpose of VSM is performance improvement, not just creating a visual artifact. It should identify and prioritize problems affecting effectiveness (timing, quantity, quality) before focusing on efficiency and cost reduction.
    

Risk of Focusing Solely on Waste Reduction:

- Simply removing waste without
    
- Barriers to smooth flow (e.g., scheduling, information flow) are often more critical than isolated instances of waste.
    

Toyota's Approach to Using VSM:

- Informing Performance Improvement: Managers use VSM to identify barriers to flow and quality, then create annual plans aligned with strategic priorities (hoshin). Teams systematically address these barriers through continuous problem solving.
    
- Seeing Performance Problems Clearly: Weekly activities like Jushiken bring together teams to map flows, balance operations, conduct experiments, and redesign processes to tackle significant workflow issues.
    

Lean Thinking vs. Doing Lean:

- Simply implementing lean tools (like VSM) isn't enough to achieve lasting results; true lean transformation requires adopting lean thinking.
    
- Lean thinking involves purposefully using tools to improve performance and build sustainable capability, not just mimicking Toyota's practices.
    

Cultural and Mindset Challenges:

- North American organizations often struggle with lean because they focus on tool implementation rather than embracing lean thinking deeply embedded in Toyota's operational philosophy.
    
- Toyota's success stems not just from tools but from a systemic approach of continuous learning and improvement ingrained in their corporate culture.
    

  

## [The Value Stream Management Maturity Model](https://www.software.broadcom.com/hubfs/ValueOps%20Maturity/vsm-maturity-model-WP_BC-VO-2023_CE-3887_v16.pdf)

Development of a VSM Maturity Model:

- Broadcom has developed a VSM maturity model based on their experience and a global survey conducted by Dimensional Research. This model aims to assist organizations at various stages of VSM adoption.
    

Survey Insights:

- The survey revealed that while many organizations have started their VSM journey, only a small percentage (about 2%) have reached advanced stages of maturity. The maturity model aims to help more teams achieve higher levels of maturity.

Broadcom conducted a global survey of over 500 professionals and executives who have responsibilities related to Value Stream Management (VSM) and digital transformation in their organizations.

The survey aimed to validate Broadcom's VSM maturity model and to establish an industry baseline for VSM maturity.

Survey questions were designed not only to assess companies' VSM maturity levels but also to identify areas of strength, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.

The data collected from the survey is analyzed within Broadcom's VSM model to provide insights into how companies can enhance their VSM practices and achieve greater maturity

  

Findings 

- Many at early stages and low VSM maturity. More than half (60%) of respondents are still in the early phases of adoption, with 13% in planning, 25% with a pilot project, and 23% running VSM on a single product. Only about 2% use VSM on all products, representing the top tiers of VSM maturity.
    
-  Excel spreadsheets the top-used tool to manage VSM. When surveyed on tools employed, Excel spreadsheets were the most common answer, with 50% of respondents continually relying upon them. 
    
- Visibility lacking. More than two-thirds say their visibility isn’t what it could or should be. 42% indicate their visibility is “OK,” and 21% characterize it as either poor or a complete “black hole.” 
    
- Teams still lack a product focus. A significant percentage, 88%, have permanent teams assigned. However, only 3% of respondents say these permanent teams are solely aligned around a single product. 
    
- Few have real-time insights. Currently, more than two-thirds (69%) of respondents share VSM metrics quarterly or monthly. Only 9% indicate this data is being made available continuously, which is a key characteristic of the most mature implementations.
    
-  Lacking metrics, lacking alignment. Surprisingly, 11% of companies don’t give employees business metrics to achieve or measure products by. 63% indicated they have metrics but that those are not mapped to individual product performance. Thus, the findings suggest that almost three-quarters of companies are missing the opportunity to have everyone aligned and focused on key objectives. 
    
- Decision-making remains centralized. For most respondents, 85%, decisions are either made at the leadership level or teams need leadership approval before implementing their decisions. Currently, only 6% say decisions are made and implemented at the team level, which is a hallmark of many of the most advanced VSM implementations.

## [Using Value Stream Management to Speed Digital Transformation and Eliminate Silos](https://www.software.broadcom.com/hubfs/VSM-Theme/PDF/HBR-Report-Using-Value-Stream-Management-to-Speed-Digital-Transformation-and-Eliminate-Silos-Verizon-%26-Boeing.pdf)

Silos:  business divisions that operate independently and avoid sharing information.

  

### Visibility: boeing example 

Challenges in Product Development: Organizations often struggle to reduce the time from idea inception to product delivery to achieve a competitive edge.

Role of VSM Platforms: Value Stream Management (VSM) platforms address various challenges across value streams by enhancing collaboration, scheduling, data transparency, managing dependencies, and eliminating redundant workstreams.

Importance of Visibility: Visibility into the product life cycle is crucial for breaking down business silos and ensuring shared visibility into workstreams, data, and funding priorities, which are essential for optimizing product or service creation.

Boeing's Journey with VSM: Boeing, despite its long history and complex structure, embarked on a VSM journey to improve innovation, safety, and organizational culture. They initially lacked visibility into their operations but used VSM to gain insights into work distribution, dependencies, and future development needs across business units.

Improvements at Boeing: Implementing VSM allowed Boeing to align project financing with portfolio investments more efficiently and reduce redundancy in analytics efforts by consolidating into a single team. They also shifted from centralized budget planning to funding based on product managers' objectives and key results.

Outcome and Success: Over the years, Boeing has refined its approach to project funding and achieved significant improvements in operational efficiency and strategic alignment, attributing much of this success to their adoption of VSM practices.

  
  

### Awareness of Budget Silos: verizon & boeing

Budgeting Challenges at Boeing: Before adopting Value Stream Management (VSM), Boeing faced issues where budget plans could change due to macroeconomic concerns, often resulting in uniform budget cuts across all departments. With VSM, Boeing shifted to budgeting based on the value of work rather than just dollars, ensuring that funding aligns with high-value initiatives like the 737 Max airplane safety enhancements.

Traditional Budgeting Limitations: Organizational budgets traditionally tied to departmental goals may not align with broader value creation objectives such as customer satisfaction or product safety. This approach lacks flexibility when business objectives shift mid-budget cycle.

Adaptation at Verizon: Verizon, in the telecommunications sector, struggled with siloed organizations that hindered cross-functional collaboration needed for managing rapid product cycles. They turned to VSM to break down silos and create a free flow of information across business teams.

Benefits of VSM at Verizon: Implementing VSM improved process visibility, enabling executives to assess the impact of strategy shifts quickly and involve relevant stakeholders. Machine learning and AI capabilities within VSM platforms at Verizon contributed to more informed, data-driven decision-making and operational efficiencies, leading to cost savings and maximizing return on investment (ROI).

  
  

### Navigating a Cultural Shift

Cultural Shift with VSM: Both Verizon and Boeing experienced significant cultural shifts when implementing Value Stream Management (VSM). This shift involved breaking down traditional business unit silos and getting employees to buy into the process changes that impact their daily work and priorities.

Challenges of Cultural Change: Changing company culture, especially in large organizations like Boeing and Verizon, is difficult. It requires shifting from a blame culture to a problem-solving culture, where teams are empowered to address and fix issues that arise.

Role of Value Stream Mapping (VSM): VSM serves as a crucial tool in cultural transformation by providing a visual representation of process flows and identifying bottlenecks. It helps in illuminating problems and aligning teams towards common goals across different business units.

Employee Engagement: Understanding one's role in the value stream improves employee engagement and reduces burnout. Employees at Verizon saw how their contributions fit into the larger picture, leading to increased job satisfaction and efficiency.

Impact on Roles and Responsibilities: The realignment of roles through VSM at Verizon aimed to focus employees on higher-value tasks rather than menial or repetitive work. This shift improved team efficiency and productivity.

Managing Change and Adaptation: VSM facilitated transparency and communication during changes in work processes at Verizon. Teams understood why changes were necessary, reducing resistance and enhancing productivity amidst market shifts.

Senior Leadership and Organizational Alignment: Successful VSM implementation requires not only support from senior executives but also cooperation from every level of the organization. It fosters transparency and effective communication, driving cultural transformation and operational improvement.

## Transactional Era:

- Historically, banking revolved around transactions. Customers visited physical branches for routine tasks like deposits and withdrawals.
    
- Channels operated independently, lacking integration.
    
- [Interactions were reactive, driven by specific needs](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-balancing-act-omnichannel-excellence-in-retail-banking).
    

  

## Multichannel Approach:

As technology advanced, banks introduced additional channels: ATMs, call centers, and online banking.

However, these channels remained siloed, resulting in fragmented service.

Customers could choose their preferred channel but experienced inconsistency

  

## Omnichannel Emergence:

The shift to omnichannel recognized the need for seamless experiences.

Key features:

- Integration: Channels connected to provide a unified view of customer data.
    
- Consistency: Customers received uniform service across touchpoints.
    
- Personalization: Data-driven insights enabled tailored interactions.
    
- Contextual Journeys: Understanding customer context allowed proactive engagement.
    

## Optimizing Customer Journeys:

Banks transitioned from isolated transactions to holistic customer journeys.

- Customer-Centric Approach:
    

- Understanding needs, preferences, and pain points.
    
- Mapping end-to-end journeys (e.g., account opening, loan application).
    
- Identifying touchpoints and addressing friction.
    

  

- Seamless Experiences:
    

- Customers seamlessly switch channels.
    
- Contextual information transfers.
    
- Personalized recommendations based on behavior.
    

  

## Technology Enablers:

- Channel Proliferation: Managing new channels (e.g., social media, voice assistants).
    
- Hyper-Personalization: AI-driven recommendations.
    
- Physical-Digital Blend: Branches as advisory centers.
    

  
  
  

# The roadmap 

### Advanced analytics for better targeting:

- Increase the effectiveness of omnichannel sales by analyzing customer transaction and digital banking data.
    
- Develop insights on customer segments and behaviors to precisely target and tailor products and value propositions.
    
- Potential to increase sales productivity by up to 40%.
    

### Data-mining techniques:

  

- Identify high-value and high-potential customers who contribute disproportionately to revenues.
    
- Create granular behavioral clusters to align sales targets and service levels with cost efficiency.
    
- Optimize lead generation by focusing on the right customers at the right time.
    

### Recent advances in analytics:

  

- Use non-linear machine-learning algorithms and granular data (Granularity is the degree to which a material or system is composed of distinguishable pieces, "granules" or "grains".) to improve prediction power and customer targeting.
    
- Banks have significantly improved commercial campaign conversion rates by integrating traditional profiles with real-time behavior data.
    
- Examples include analyzing daily transactions and website activity for more precise customer targeting.

## Marketing personalization across channels:

  

Digitally mature companies in retail use cross-channel and personalized digital marketing to create bespoke customer journeys.

Banks should adopt these methods, focusing on channel combinations that include human touchpoints for greater success.

#### Digital marketing techniques:

  

Track customer clicks across web pages and measure time spent on particular subjects.

Connect this data to analytics engines to personalize messaging.

Use online customer behavior as a signal of interest to quickly make the right offer.

#### Coordination of efforts:

  

Coordinate efforts across channels, customer relationship management teams, and external agencies.

Consider creating an integrated digital marketing “war room.”

Lack of coordination can result in losing customers between misaligned channels.

Role of human intervention in sales:

  

Direct channels (emails, internet/mobile banking notifications, text messages) often require human follow-up to finalize purchases.

Customers who research online and then engage with a person for the final purchase have higher conversion rates.

A bank saw a 30% increase in sales when there was a timely (24-48 hours) human response compared to a purely digital journey.

  

## [Lean value stream](https://www.lean.org/lexicon-terms/value-stream-mapping/) : guidelines towards effective VSM

Produce to Your Takt Time:

- Definition: Takt time is the rate at which products need to be produced to match customer demand.
    
- Purpose: It serves as a pace-setter for production, aligning output with customer requirements and preventing overproduction or underproduction.
    

Develop Continuous Flow Wherever Possible:

- Continuous Flow: Producing one piece at a time and immediately passing it to the next process step.
    
- Advantages: Minimizes waiting times, reduces inventory, and enhances responsiveness to changes in demand.
    

Use Supermarkets to Control Production:

- Supermarket Pull System: Where continuous flow is not feasible, use supermarkets (buffer stock points) to control production.
    
- Purpose: Links production directly to customer demand downstream, avoiding overproduction and ensuring resources are used efficiently.
    

Send Customer Schedule to One Production Process:

- Pacemaker Process: Schedule production based on customer demand at one critical point in the value stream.
    
- Benefits: Simplifies scheduling, stabilizes production flow, and ensures synchronization with customer requirements.
    

Level the Production Mix (Heijunka):

- Definition: Evenly distribute production of different products over time at the pacemaker process.
    
- Purpose: Reduces lead times, evens out workloads, and enables faster response to changing customer demands with less inventory.
    

Create an Initial Pull with Paced Withdrawal:

- Paced Withdrawal: Release and withdraw small, consistent increments of work at the pacemaker process.
    
- Advantages: Establishes a predictable production flow, facilitates problem identification, and enables faster corrective actions.
